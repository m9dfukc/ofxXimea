# ofxXimea
This is a simple Openframeworks implementation of the Ximea m3api for adding xIQ machine vision cameras to your project.

XI_RGB32 and XI_MONO8 modes are supported, as is verbose error reporting, interactive AWB and binning. XI_RAW has not yet been implemented. Cameras can be selected through an interactive CLI dialog or set with known index numbers. 

Works great with MANY cameras streaming simultaniously.

ofxOpenCV is required.
